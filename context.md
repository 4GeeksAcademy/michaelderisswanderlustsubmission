Wanderlust Labs is a travel-tech startup building a platform where users can discover and save curated experiences around the world — from street-food tours in Bangkok to sailing trips in the Adriatic. Their product designer has already produced reference mockups (you'll find them in the brief below), and the engineering team needs a frontend developer to bring the MVP explorer to life.

You've been assigned to build the experience explorer: a multi-page React/Next.js application where users can browse, search, and filter experiences — all without reloading the page. The frontend lead handed you a Figma reference and a brief from the PM. Before writing a single component, spend some time finding 2–3 real interfaces you admire that match the expected feel: a clean discovery UI with cards, a search bar, and a sidebar or top filter bar. Use them to guide your design decisions and note them in your repo's README under a "Design References" section.

Your dataset will be 100 generated experiences. The PM wants the search and filters to live in the URL so that users can share links like /experiences?search=sailing&category=adventure&destination=Croatia and land on a pre-filtered view.

Your PM, Lea Moreau, sent the following spec over Slack:

Pages required
/ — Home: hero section with a call-to-action button that navigates to /experiences
/experiences — Explorer: full list of experience cards with a search bar and at least two filters (category and destination). The search and active filters must be reflected in the URL as query parameters and must pre-fill the inputs on load.
/experiences/[id] — Detail: full information for one experience, fetched from the local dataset by ID
/favorites — Favorites: list of experiences the user has marked as favorite (stored in component state for now)
/profile — Profile: a static page with a mock user profile and a summary of their saved favorites count
Search behavior
The search should filter experiences whose title matches the search term. Use a case-insensitive regex for this — something like /term/i. The filter by category and destination should work independently and stack with the search.

Dataset
Use an AI coding assistant to generate an array of 100 experience objects. Each object should have at minimum: id, title, description, category (one of: Adventure, Culture, Food, Wellness, Nature), destination (city + country), price, rating, and imageUrl (any placeholder). Save it as a local TypeScript file.

Favorites
A heart icon on each card should toggle the experience in/out of the user's favorites list. Favorites are kept in a useState at the top level and passed down as props where needed. No persistence required yet.

Requirements:
Use an AI coding assistant to generate an array of 100 experience objects and save it as src/data/experiences.ts
Define a TypeScript interface Experience for the data shape and use it throughout the project
Add a # Design References section to your README.md with links or screenshots of 2–3 real UIs that inspired your design
Create a Home page (/) with a hero section and a button that navigates to /experiences
Create an Explorer page (/experiences) with all 100 experience cards rendered in a grid
Create a Detail page (/experiences/[id]) that reads the experience ID from the URL and displays the full card content
Create a Favorites page (/favorites) that shows only the experiences the user has favorited
Create a Profile page (/profile) with a mock user profile and the count of saved favorites
Add a search bar to the Explorer page that filters experiences by title
Use a case-insensitive regex to match the search term against each experience’s title (e.g. new RegExp(term, 'i').test(experience.title))
Add a category filter (dropdown or button group) using the five available categories
Add a destination filter (dropdown or search) that filters by destination city or country
All active filters and the search term must be stored as URL query parameters using useSearchParams and usePathname from Next.js
On page load, read the query params from the URL and pre-fill the search bar and filter inputs with their values
Add a heart icon (toggle) to each experience card
Store the list of favorite IDs in a useState at a shared level and pass it down via props
The heart icon must visually reflect whether the experience is in favorites or not
Create at minimum: ExperienceCard, SearchBar, FilterBar, Navbar
Use useEffect in at least one component (e.g. to sync the filtered results when query params change, or to update the document title on the detail page)
Create at least one custom hook (e.g. useExperiences or useFilters) that encapsulates filtering logic
The app must be responsive (mobile + desktop)
The Explorer grid must show a “No results found” message when filters produce zero matches
The Navbar must be present on all pages and show active link styles using usePathname
Do not use any external state management library (Redux, Zustand, etc.). All state must live in React’s built-in useState and be passed via props or custom hooks.
The app has at least 5 distinct pages with working client-side navigation (no full-page reloads between routes)
Search filters results by title using a regex match
Category and destination filters work independently and combine correctly with the search term
Active filters and search term are reflected in the URL as query params
On page load with existing query params, inputs are pre-filled and results are already filtered
useEffect is used correctly with appropriate dependency arrays (no infinite loops, no missing dependencies)
useState is used to manage favorites and passed correctly as props
At least one custom hook exists and encapsulates meaningful logic
Components are split logically — no single file contains the entire app
TypeScript types/interfaces are defined and used consistently
The app is responsive and visually coherent across pages
Design references are documented in the README
